DATA IMPORT
-----

1) Perform a dump (see esent_dump).

The esent_dump.exe tool will produce the following files:
ace-ntds.dit-dump.csv	actual content of security descriptors
obj-ntds.dit-dump.csv	object data

2) Put both files *with these filenames* in the import/data/ folder.

3) Change working directory to import/ and run the batch file to import data:
$ cd import/
import$ ./import_ace_data.sh <arg>

The import_ace_data.sh script takes one argument:
none	does not perform the last two join operations. RAW data will still be 
	browsable.
fast	does a single join, and does not try to "decode" trustee SIDs. 
	TrusteeSID is still decoded on-the-fly by the frontend, but is nothing
	easily searchable.
full	does two join operations, that will fill the TructeeCN field, thus 
	making it searchable and human-readable. This will slow import 
	operations.


Data file will be:
- copied to a temporary folder;
- parsed and imported into a generic table, which schema will be generated from
file header (type will be varchar(255) for every column but those named in
columns_int.txt);
- distributed across various tables to allow on-the-fly decoding of SIDs and 
GUIDs by the frontend;
- joined to precompute two result tables which will be the ones to browser for 
auditing purposes : ACE_AD and ACE_EXCH.

THESE TABLES ARE OVERWRITTEN BY EVERY IMPORT.
This allows for periodic auditing and session replay (see FEATURES.txt).

4) Browse the audit tables: 
- by table name: ACE_AD and ACE_EXCH
- by table description (only tables that are imported by the scripts have 
descriptions)
- you should probably hide most columns on your first run (H link next to column
names) and keep only masks and DNs

5) Don't forget to save you sessions to replay them at a later date: see the 
bottom of the frontend.

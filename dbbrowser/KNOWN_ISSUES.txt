KNOWN ISSUES
-----

GENERAL

- Ugly code. The browser was done in roughly 1 day of coding, then just-in-time
adjustments.
- Full of SQL injections, XSS, whatever vulnerability you may find. Well, this 
is a SQL-query generator after all.
- Full of hardcoded cases.

- You may completely crash the browser with erroneous SQL queries. Just reset 
your session by visiting /index.php?logtable=ADEMPTY

FILTERS/SEARCH

- Some field values are not properly escaped by quick/global filters and result
in the inability to search for specific values.

SESSIONS

- Sessions may be broken if PHP is updated. Session files might not be 
transferrable to other instances of the dbbrowser.

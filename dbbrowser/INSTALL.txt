INITIAL SETUP
-----

1) Create a mysql database and a user with read/write permissions on it.
Default configuration assumes the following: 
username: auditad
password: auditad
database: auditad

Different users may be used for data import (scripts) and audit (php frontend).

2) Edit www/settings.php accordingly.

3) Change your current working directory to the import/ folder then run the init script:
create_default_db.sh

It will simply create the default DB structure (from default_db_schema.sql).

4) It works! You are ready to import data.
See USAGE.txt on how to use the scripts.

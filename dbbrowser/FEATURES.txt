FRONTEND FEATURES OVERVIEW
-----

The frontend is a simple SQL query generator and SQL table browser.
You can:
- browse ANY MySQL table
- generate filters by clicking on results and fields
- hide some fields
- perform NATURAL JOINs with 2 other tables
- perform COUNT() operations on a specific field
- sort results
- dump results to TSV files
- export/import your filter list
- save/restore/share your search session

A few features are discussed below.

-----
GLOBAL FILTERS
-----

Global filters are multiple WHERE clauses defined by clicking a filter link to 
include (==) or exclude (!=) particular results.

They add up to the global filter list and may be dropped individually at any 
time.

Using the search form at the top also sets up global filters.

All filters are considered equally: all of them have to be satisfied to have a 
corresponding result (AND). It is not yet possible to specify alternatives in 
global filters (OR).

-----
QUICK FILTERS
-----

A quick filter is a single temporary WHERE clause. You can set it up by simply
clicking an element, which will filter the results for the clicked value in the 
considered field.

Typical use case is to browse results and "surf" from one field to another: say
you are looking at a user's mailbox, and put a quick filter for that user (i.e.
clicked on his name in the DistinguishedName column). Seeing what other mailboxes his
trustees can also access is just one click away: just click on the trustee name 
in the TrusteeSID or TrusteeCN column, and you will switch to that view.

Global filters are not affected.

-----
SEARCH FORM
-----

Search form allows one to search specific fields for value using SQL operators
other than = and !=.

Syntax mimics SQL syntax. By default, spaces will be replaced by '%' wildcards.

You may search for a field's value in another field by leaving the textbox empty 
and selecting the other field in the dropdown list next to it which defaults to 
"*text search (use text field)*".

-----
FILTER IMPORT/EXPORT
-----

The global filter list may be exported to a basic text file, one WHERE clause
by line.
You may also modify this file before importing it to have more complex filters
that the frontend cannot generate (i.e. search on substrings, etc.).

-----
SESSIONS
-----

The current audit session may be saved (all filters, shown fields, state of 
preferences...), restored and shared:
- enter a description, click 'save' and the session name will appear in the 
dropdown list;
- select one, click restore to resume a session. This will redirect to a URL 
that can be shared to other users to assist in auditing.
